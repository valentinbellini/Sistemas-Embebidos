## What’s in This Repo  
This repository contains practical assignments from my university Embedded Systems courses. It includes:
- Microcontroller programming tasks  
- Real-time applications  
- Interfacing with sensors and actuators  
- Communication protocols (e.g., UART, I2C, SPI)

Each folder corresponds to a specific lab or project and typically contains code (C/C++), schematics, and reports.

## Important Notes

Explanations and documentation are mostly written in Spanish.

The code is intended for educational use and academic reference.

Feel free to fork, improve, or adapt for your own embedded projects.
